# Terraform Project for AWS and Azure Infrastructure

This repository contains Terraform configurations to manage infrastructure on **AWS** and **Azure**. The project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision resources such as an S3 bucket in AWS and a Resource Group in Azure.

## Project Structure

/terraform-project/ ├── aws-creation-terraform.txt # Notes or steps for AWS setup ├── azure-creating-terraform.txt # Notes or steps for Azure setup ├── main.tf # Main resource definitions ├── provider.tf # Provider blocks for AWS and Azure ├── terraform.tfvars # Variable values for both providers ├── variables.tf # Variables definitions └── outputs.tf # Optional outputs after apply


## Prerequisites

- **Terraform** installed (v1.0.0+ recommended)
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials
- **Azure CLI** configured with credentials

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-project.git
    cd terraform-project
    ```

2. **Edit `terraform.tfvars`** with your specific values:

    ```hcl
    aws_region = "us-east-1"
    location   = "West Europe"
    prefix     = "demo"
    ```

3. **Initialize Terraform** (downloads the provider plugins):

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4. **Validate the configuration**:

    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```

5. **Plan the deployment** to preview the infrastructure changes:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

6. **Apply the changes** to create the resources:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    This will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to proceed.

## Terraform Files Breakdown

- **provider.tf**: Defines the provider blocks for AWS and Azure, setting the region and required credentials.
- **variables.tf**: Declares the variables used in the project, including AWS region and Azure location.
- **terraform.tfvars**: Holds the values for the variables declared in `variables.tf`.
- **main.tf**: Contains the Terraform resources that define the infrastructure to be created. It currently defines an **AWS S3 bucket** and an **Azure Resource Group**.
- **outputs.tf**: (Optional) You can define outputs for information like resource names, IP addresses, etc.

## AWS Resources

Currently, this project provisions the following AWS resources:

- **S3 Bucket**: A private S3 bucket named with the defined `prefix`.

### Example AWS Resource (S3 Bucket)

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "${var.prefix}-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
Azure Resources
This project provisions an Azure Resource Group with the following properties:

Resource Group: A resource group named with the defined prefix in the location specified.

Example Azure Resource (Resource Group)
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-rg"
  location = var.location
}
Variables
This project uses the following variables:

aws_region (string): AWS region for deploying resources (e.g., us-east-1).

location (string): Azure region for deploying resources (e.g., West Europe).

prefix (string): A prefix to name the resources uniquely.

Example of terraform.tfvars
aws_region = "us-east-1"
location   = "West Europe"
prefix     = "demo"
Outputs
You can define outputs to capture values like resource names, IP addresses, etc., after running terraform apply. For example:
output "aws_s3_bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.example.bucket
}

output "azure_resource_group_name" {
  value = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}
Cleanup
To remove the resources created by Terraform, you can run:
terraform destroy
This will prompt you to confirm the deletion. Type yes to proceed.

### Key Highlights:
- **Project Structure**: Clear layout of files.
- **Instructions**: Easy-to-follow steps to get started and deploy infrastructure on both AWS and Azure.
- **Usage**: Details for configuring `terraform.tfvars`, running commands, and cleaning up resources.
- **Variables**: Explanation of variables and how they’re used.
- **Outputs**: Optional section to define outputs for use post-deployment.

Once you fill in your actual `AWS` and `Azure` credentials and resources, this will be ready to share on GitHub. Would you like any specific customization or extra details for this `README`?
